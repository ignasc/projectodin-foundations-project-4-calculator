### Main challenges

The biggest challenge was to build a logic that would create a strict sequence of entering first number, operator and second number. This included a few additional features:

- Add decimal point.
- Continue operation with the answer.
- Automatically start at "0." when pressing decimal point without digit.
- Ability to change operator before entering second number.
